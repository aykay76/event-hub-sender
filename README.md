Send events to Azure Event Hub

This is a basic C# example of how to send events to an Azure Event Hub. The content of the event is hard coded but can easily be modified or taken from configuration or other sources.

There is only one configuration item; the connection string for the Event Hub which is stored in app.config.

Next I will look at building an Electron based app using the JS client..
